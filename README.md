## SQL (STRUCTURED QUERY LANGUAGE)
It stores and manages data in a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS). It is a standard language for Relational Database Systems. It enables a user to relate databases and tables. All the RDBMS, like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, MS Access, and SQL servers, use SQL as the standard database language. 
SQL is used for storing, retrieving, and managing data. It is a standard language for querying, retrieving and deleting data. SQL is not case sensitive i.e. it can be written in either upper case or lower case. It depends on tuple relational calculus and relational algebra i.e. mathematical or statistical calculations can be done. SQL is a great tool for analysing multiple data at once and it allows to analyse more complex questions than dashboard tools.

**Database**: It is an organized collection of data stored, and managed in a structured way to allow for easy access, retrieval and manipulation. 
**Database stores data** in a structured format using tables which are composed of rows and columns. Each table represents a specific type of data, and the row is called RECORD while the column is referred to as FIELD.

**Data in Database** is stored in tables that can be thought of just like Excel spreadsheets. All data in the same column must match in terms of data type.
**A table** is an organised data composed of rows and columns.
